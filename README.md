# tournament-tracker
Text-based application to run tournament participants tracker.

Note that attached CSV files are a result of the application and any (new) tournament initiated to be tracked will generate a new CSV file with tournament name.

The current application requires the user to save their changes after EACH change in order to not lose your progress. IF YOU DO NOT SAVE YOUR CHANGE BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER CHANGE, YOUR FIRST CHANGE WILL BE LOST. Future versions of the application will fix this issue.
